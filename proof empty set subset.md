#proof 
# [[proof-by-contradiction]]: 
we assume there exists a [[set]] $M$, for which $\emptyset \nsubseteq M$. with the definition of ![[contains raw does contain]]there should exists a [[element]] in $\emptyset$ that is not also an [[element]] of $M$. the [[empty-set]] is **empty** by definition. 
this is a contradiction
