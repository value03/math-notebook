## Logical equivalence 
We say that one [[statement]] is **equivalent** to another if one is true **if, and only if** the other is too.

$A$ |$B$  | $A\Leftrightarrow B$  
------------ | ------------  | ------------  
0 | 1 |0
1 | 0 |0 
1 | 1 |1 
0 | 0 |1

> *remark: $A\Leftrightarrow B$ is equivalent to $(A\Rightarrow B)\land (A\Leftarrow B)$, which we can use to [[proof|prove]]
> an eqivalence through [[proof|proving]] both directions* . 
>-proving equivalence
