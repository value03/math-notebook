#proof 
to prove: ![[cardinality rules raw]]
(i): the [[element]]s that occur both in $A$ as in $B$ are accounted for only once in $A\cup B$, but are exaclty the [[element]]s of $A\cap B$. To count the [[set cardinality]] of both [[set]]s we need to add the [[set cardinality|cardinality]] of the [[Union]] and [[intersection]]. 
(ii): the number of combinations of [[n-tuple]] with $n=2, i.e:(a,b)$ with all $a\in A$ and $b\in B$ is exactly $|A|\cdot|B|$ 
(iii):
