### cartesian plane
if we form the [[cartesian product]] of the [[Real-numbers]] $\mathbb{R}:$ 
$$\mathbb{R}^2 = \{(0,0), (1,0), (0,1), (4, 7), (\sqrt{2}, \pi), ...\}$$
the [[element]]s reminds of [[point]]s with [[coordinates]] in the x and y. For three dimensional spaces, we need three [[Real-numbers]]. We just use $\mathbb{R}^3$ and get the [[set]] $\{(0,0, 0), (1,0, 0), (0,1, 0),...\}$.
In [[physics]] we need much higher dimensional Spaces.
