# Logical Syntax
we use Logical Operators to chain [[statement|statements]] together. We can use Tables to visualize what effect they have on the [[truthvalue|thruthvalues]]. 
![[negation]]
![[disjunction]]
![[conjunction]] 
## other operators
other operators are the [[Xor]] which is a exclusive [[or]], meaning that it only accepts either $A$ or $B$ to be true but not both. The [[NAND]] operator is simply the negation of the [[AND]] operator.
