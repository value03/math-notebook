# Statement
A statement can be any formulation, that can be true or false. 
examples:
- all cats have fur
- my eyes are blue
- the migration politics of South Africa is too liberal
In mathematics, those statements are mostly formulated with numbers but also text.

- for any number $a \in \mathbb{N}$  $2a < a^2$ must hold.
- $a<b$
- if $a<b$ then $a^2<b^2$ must hold

we can express wether a [[statement]]'s true or false with a [[truthvalue]]
