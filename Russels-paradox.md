# Russell's paradox
This famous paradox uncovered faults in [[set-cantor|cantor's set definition]] 

we define a collection, which fits [[set-cantor|cantors definition]].
$$M = \{x|x\notin x\}  \text{ i.e the set of all elements that do not contain themselves}$$
Now we ask if the set $M$ contains itself. there are only two options:
$$\text{either } M\in M \text{ or } M\notin M$$
- if $M\in M$, then $M \notin M$ must follow, which is a [[proof-by-contradiction | contradiction]].
- if $M\notin M$, then $M \in M$ must follow, which is a also [[proof-by-contradiction | contradiction]].
which produces the weird conclusion that $M\notin M \land M\in M$. 

## solution
The new definition of [[set]]s grounds on axioms. This is very high level mathematics and would require pages of information.
