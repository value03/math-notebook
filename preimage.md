### preimage
For a [[Function]] $f$, with [[domain]] $X$ and [[codomain]] $Y$, the [[preimage]] of an [[element]] $y$ in $Y$ is the [[set]] of all [[ element|elements]] of the [[domain]] $X$ whose [[image|images]] under $f$ equal $y$. The [[preimage]] of [[element]] $y$ is denoted as $f^{-1}(y)$. $$f^{-1}(y) = \{ x\in X| f(x) =y \}$$ Let $A$ be a [[subset]] of $Y$, then the [[preimage]] of $A$, is the set of all $x\in X$ whose [[image]]
belongs to $A$.
